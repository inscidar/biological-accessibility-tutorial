# Notebook Accessibility
This folder is for the Notebooks Accessibility session. 

## Overview
The first notebook shows certain guidelines on how to construct accessible notebooks, which we are presenting.

## Exercise
Look at the second notebook, which is a [tutorial from squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/tutorials/tutorial_slideseqv2.html) (also available on their [github](https://github.com/scverse/squidpy_notebooks/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_slideseqv2.ipynb)). What do they do well? Where could they improve?
