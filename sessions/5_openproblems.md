Here, we list a few open problems and our solutions in the space of accessibility of biological data. 
 
## Accessibility of Genomic Visualization

* Challenges
    * Variety of visualization designs (e.g., Circos, Sequence Logos)
    * Many visualizations at once (8.1 tracks on average)
    * User interactions (e.g., zoom and pan)

## AltGosling ([Demo](https://gosling-lang.github.io/altgosling/), [Paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/40/12/btae670/7900296))

Automatic generation of text descriptions for accessible genomics data visualization

## Blace ([Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670517))

LLM-based Multimodal Visualization Authoring

## Accessibility of Data Portals

In our study, only 55.3% were successful for a screen reader to perform common tasks in data portals ([inscidar.org](https://inscidar.org)).

![Four subpanels show the results of the manual accessibility evaluation results, showing time taken each of the 10 tasks and subjective responses on confidence, satisfaction, and frustration levels. The first subpanel shows the summary of the results for three data portals while the rest show the individual results for data portals.](../assets/imgs/inscidar-user-study-result.jpg)

## INSCIDAR Project

You can visit our project website ([inscidar.org](https://inscidar.org)) to see our evaluation results and visualizations. We will run accessibility evaluation annually and release the results in this website.
